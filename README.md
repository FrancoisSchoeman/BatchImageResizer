# BatchImageResizer
### Batch Image Resizer - made using Python and TkInter.

The program resizes all images inside a folder to match a specific width. You can resize in any supported format, and type in a custom title for the images.
By simply leaving the Image Name field blank you can also resize the images while still having the same original titles (the new images have numbers added to the end of the file name to ensure that the original images are not replaced).

### Requirements
- Pillow | `pip install Pillow`
- AW Themes package for the dark theme
