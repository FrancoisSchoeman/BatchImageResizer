# BatchImageResizer
### Batch Image Resizer - made using Python and TkInter.

The program resizes all images inside a folder to match a specific width. You can resize in any supported format, and type in a custom title for the images.
You can also resize the images while still having the same original titles (the new images have numbers added to the end of the file name).

### Requirements
- Pillow | `pip install Pillow`
- AW Themes package for the dark theme

### Caution
Make sure that your folder only contains images, no other files are allowed (except folders within the main folder) and it will make the program crash. I have yet to fix this issue. I also need to do some heavy refactoring.
